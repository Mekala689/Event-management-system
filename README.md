# Event-management-system
1. Event management in colleges is still manual, using paper forms and emails.


2. This causes delays, miscommunication, and double bookings.


3. No centralized platform exists to track event requests or approvals.


4. Poor record-keeping leads to scheduling conflicts and last-minute issues.


5. Students, faculty, and admin spend excess time coordinating manually.
   
**Proposed Solution**

1. Develop a web-based Event Management System (EMS) to handle all event processes digitally.


2. Provide dedicated portals for students, faculty, and admin for transparency.


3. Automate event requests, approvals, and notifications in a single platform.


4. Include Smart Schedule Optimizer to suggest best time slots and avoid clashes.

**Team work**
1. UI/UX Design: Created main screens and flow (by [Mekala S]).


2. System Workflow: Designed event and approval process (by [KaviPriya P]).


3. Feature Documentation: Defined Smart Scheduler & Gamified System (by [Ramya M]).






5. Add a Gamified Participation System â€“ students earn points, badges, and ranks for participation (unique feature).
